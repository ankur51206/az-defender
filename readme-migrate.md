Preparation:

    Review Resources: Take some time to familiarize yourself with the official migration guide: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-migration

    Identify Workspaces: Locate the Azure Log Analytics workspace(s) currently associated with your Log Analytics agents. You can find this information within the Azure portal under Monitor > Log Analytics workspaces.

Migration Steps:

1. Install Azure Monitor Agent:

    VMs (Azure and Azure Arc-enabled On-Premises):
        Login to the Azure portal and navigate to your VM or Azure Arc-enabled server.
        Go to Settings > Extensions.
        Click on Add and search for "Azure Monitor Agent for VMs".
        Select the appropriate version and configure the workspace ID associated with your Azure Monitor workspace.
        Deploy the extension to your VM.

    On-Premises VMs (No Azure Arc):
        Download the installer for your specific operating system (Windows or Linux) from the following links:
            Windows: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-windows-client
            Linux: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview
        Follow the installation instructions provided on the respective download pages. Remember to specify the workspace ID during installation.

2. Data Collection Rule Creation:

    DCR Generator: This tool helps convert your existing Log Analytics agent configuration into data collection rules (DCRs) for the Azure Monitor agent.
        Access the DCR Config Generator tool from the Azure portal by navigating to Monitor > Log Analytics workspaces > [Your Workspace] > Agents > Azure Monitor Agent.
        Click on Data collection rules and select Generate data collection rules.
        Follow the on-screen instructions to connect to your workspace and download the generated DCRs.

    Define Data Collection:  Within the generated DCRs (JSON files), review and customize the data collection configurations. This includes specifying the specific data you want to collect from each agent (e.g., performance counters, logs).
